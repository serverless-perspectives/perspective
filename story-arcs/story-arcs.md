## 'Colloquial Painted Picture'

1. Describe a day-in-the-life of a member of a highly mature, creative, cross-functional team, call him team member 'X', and he works at XCorp
    1. 'X' starts his day with a summary of results of the previous day's experiments. 1.2 million variations were run. Of those, 97.2% showed little or no change over business as usual.
    1. However, a small set of experiments run in an emerging market segment in Brazil are showing a potential 7-11% growth in profit. 'X' wants to dig deeper.
    1. 'X' has scanned the global news summary and cross-referenced it with the XCorps's proprietary product sentiment analysis algorithm. 
    1. 'X' thinks the impact a recent market entrant has had in Brazil is changing the prevailing wisdom, and therefore speed of adoption rate, of the product the company is working to develop.
    1. The team convenes for the daily HGS, or Hypothesis Generation Session. (There's no need to share status because the team has entrusted every member with full visibility into each other's work-activities.)
    1. 'X' proposes an experiment to test his theory on speed of adoption: 
        1. Generate possible news headlines and social feed activity in three categories:
            1. *'Brazilian Government issues health and safety recommendation in favor of [new product], saying it will save lives and improve productivity'*
            1. *'[Large entrenched player] releases [competitor to new product] at [price point]'*
            1. *'XCorp releases [new product], limited availability within [emerging market segment]'*
        1. Feed the sample data into the proprietary product sentiment analysis algorithm
        1. Compare current projected path to modified projected path
    1. 'X' shares with team that he hopes to use the results of the experiment to feed into the Next Level recommendation engine. If results show little or no change, the existing release schedule and product definition should remain unchanged. If, however, a limited release could secure a first-mover advantage, the data may suggest that existing production-line bottlenecks should not prevent a more limited rollout in the identified target market.
    1. Team member 'Y' offers a refinement to the experiment. By cross-referencing seasonal purchasing patterns, he believes the results will more accurately reflect consumer adoption rates over the next 3-6 months. Since this data is public, the additional cost of the experiment is small.
    1. Team member 'Z' isn't immediately convinced, especially given their dwindling Experiment Runway Budget. As of yesterday, the team only had a bleak 72 experiments remaining. Positive results from the a prior roll-up, however, have increased their runway to a promising 126. 'Z' has a change of heart.
    1. With a bit of the budget pressure relieved, 'Z' suggest that it would be wise for the team to conduct an experiment with and without seasonality data. Worst case, they've ruled out seasonality as a variable. Best case, they can save the company money with a launch in the season with most impact.
    1. 'Y' has checked out compute costs for the next 8 hours. There's a projected decrease in demand in 3 hours that will allow the team to expend 0.5 experiment credits instead of 2. Given the longer-range purpose of the experiment, the team quickly agrees to save the 1.5 credits and places their bid for 3 hours from now.
    1. The team adjourns the HGS. They'll revisit the experiment as soon as they are notified of the results. 
    1. 'X' signs out and begins interpreting results from the 267 peer-teams across the enterprise. Interestingly, group 92 has identified a new product concept that gives 'X' ideas for a new model he'd like to test. He begins formalizing the model for tomorrow's HGS.
1. Pose some questions: 
    1. Could your company benefit from better data, well-formed experiments, and self-executing teams?
    1. How does IT resource scarcity help/hinder this level of execution? 
    1. Storage is cheap, what if compute were, too?
    1. How does fully harnessing IT help scale effective communication?
    1. How would you execute on this kind of experiment in your organization?
        1. Approvals
        1. Communication
        1. Compliance
        1. Board approval
        1. Financing
    1. Is executing at this level specific to an industry? Could you think of ways to adapt it to yours?

## 'Deconstructing Assumptions' [@HowtoWri11:online]

1. Start with assumptions:
    1. IT Talent is scarce
    1. Regulations are burdensome
    1. Decision-making is based on wisdom
    1. Teams can't be trusted
    1. Communication is expensive but necessary
    1. Compute is expensive and error-prone
1. Which will hold? Which should be re-framed?
1. Work up to a picture of the future from the new set of assumptions.

## 'Story by metaphor'

1. Start with the lightbulb - everyone wanted cheap access to safe, healthy, reliable light.
    1. Darkness was limiting at best, dangerous at worst
    1. Cost of candles
    1. Gas lamps
    1. Electric lights
1. Delivering cheap light via a bulb, however, would have been impossible without a way to supply electricity.
1. Power grid was the innovation that made the promise of cheap light come true.
1. BUT, the power grid wasn't only used to light homes and businesses. 
1. Cheap, reliable electricity ushered in the advent of an electronics innovation boom. Innovations (including computers and the internet) would never have come to be without affordable forms of electricity.
1. If each business needed it's own power-grid to create new products, 'CEO' would surely still stand for Chief Electricity Officer [@Chiefdat33:online]
1. Serverless will usher in a similar innovation boom for compute.
