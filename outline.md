##  What is serverless?

1. Elucidating tools, patterns, and practices
    1. Functions as a Service
        1. Variable cost application models
    1. Utility computing
    1. Frameworks
        1. Serverless [@serverless]
        1. SAM (Serverless Application Model)
        1. Others?

## What's the future of IT?

1. Imagine a world...

##  How does serverless get me to that end state?
    
1. It's already well understood how to get there (concepts and how serverless is a helpful tool for enabling)
    1. API-driven development
        1. Platforms as a first-class citizen
        1. Meta-data analysis and informed decision making
    1. Value chain analysis
        1. Purposefully evolve the ecosystem
        1. Focus on value creation
    1. Two pizza teams
        1. Decoupled architecture
        1. Accelerate the feedback cycles
            1. Owning the OODA (observe, orient, decide, and act) loop [@ooda]

## When should I adopt serverless?

1. Serverless use cases, a primer
    1. API platforms
        1. External
        1. Internal
    1. Application development
        1. Green field
        1. Brown field 
    1. Automation in the cloud

## Adoption path

1. Enterprise IT
    1. How wide with the chasm be when a faster development loop meets potentially drastic cost savings when savings are viewed holistically (i.e. compute/storage evaluated alongside people/organization/logistics)
        1. Develop a back-of-the-envelope estimate methodology
        1. Make informed prediction along the lines of "X% of new enterprise app dev will be done on some version of a serverless stack by 2020"
    1. Existing enterprise apps difficult/impossible to port to Serverless approaches with reasonably 
    1. Difficulties compounded by contracts/licensing/ownership issues of Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) deployments within the enterprise
    1. How to deal with old and new data
1. Products
    1. SaaS products benefit
    1. Fewer barriers to adoption for key product offering (but not ancillary or )
    1. 12-factor is quickly emerging as a standard/best practice for SaaS, which is easier to implement with Serverless [@12factor]
1. Independent/App Developers
    1. Quickest adoption cycle 

## Examples
1. Monetizing your services with AWS Marketplace and API Gateway
1. Secure automated serverless delivery at scale
1. Voice interactions with Alexa Skills
1. Function orchestration with Step Functions
1. API meta-data ingestion and storage
1. API meta-data analysis
1. Bakeoff: AWS Lambda Functions, Azure Functions, Google Cloud Functions, & Apache OpenWhisk
1. Bakeoff pt II: Serverless Framework, Apex, & Claudia
