##  What is serverless?

1. Elucidating tools, patterns, and practices
    1. Functions as a Service
        1. Variable cost application models
    1. Utility computing
    1. Frameworks
        1. Serverless [@serverless]
        1. SAM (Serverless Application Model)
        1. Others?

##  Why should I use serverless?
    
1. Helping you do what you know you should be doing already
    1. API-driven development
        1. Platforms as a first-class citizen
        1. Meta-data analysis and informed decision making
    1. Value chain analysis
        1. Purposefully evolve the ecosystem
        1. Focus on value creation
1. Two pizza teams
    1. Decoupled architecture
    1. Accelerate the feedback cycles
        1. Owning the OODA (observe, orient, decide, and act) loop [@ooda]
1. Serverless use cases, a primer
    1. API platforms
        1. External
        1. Internal
    1. Application development
        1. Green field
        1. Brown field 
    1. Automation in the cloud

## Adoption path

1. Enterprise IT
    1. How wide with the chasm be when a faster development loop meets potentially drastic cost savings when savings are viewed holistically (i.e. compute/storage evaluated alongside people/organization/logistics)
        1. Develop a back-of-the-envelope estimate methodology
        1. Make informed prediction along the lines of "X% of new enterprise app dev will be done on some version of a serverless stack by 2020"
    1. Existing enterprise apps difficult/impossible to port to Serverless approaches with reasonably 
    1. Difficulties compounded by contracts/licensing/ownership issues of Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) deployments within the enterprise
    1. How to deal with old and new data
1. Products
    1. SaaS products benefit
    1. Fewer barriers to adoption for key product offering (but not ancillary or )
    1. 12-factor is quickly emerging as a standard/best practice for SaaS, which is easier to implement with Serverless [@12factor]
1. Independent/App Developers
    1. Quickest adoption cycle 

## Examples
