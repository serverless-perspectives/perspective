Future world
- Speed of idea to production increases, could drop to a single day
- Data analytics effort by ops shifts from uptime to business value metrics
- No more undifferentiated heavy lifting!
- All of this removes you from working in the bottom half of the value chain - leave that to the cloud providers

After teams have removed themselves from bottom half of value chains, what do they look like?
- Product owners are experimenters, hypothesizers, model-builders
    - Learn how to posit and validate results
- We don't know what exactly this enables but it can only be good
    - Remove scarcity of time and money
    - Analogous to other utility revolutions - bolts, electricity, etc.
- Chief constraint of business scalability no longer IT
    - Decoupled the lockstep pattern of IT buildout and business buildout
    - Decoupling IT speed/agility from ability to innovate


Concerns people might have about these claims
- This is too far in the Future
- Works for Netflix but too hard for companies like mine to achieve
